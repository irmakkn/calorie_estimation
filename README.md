# calorie_estimation
In this project, a machine learning model was developed to predict calorie consumption based on various physiological and activity-related features, including Age, Height, Weight, Duration, Heart Rate, and Body Temperature. The dataset was preprocessed to handle outliers using logarithmic transformations for skewed features. 


The model was trained and validated, achieving a low RMSE and a high RÂ² score, indicating accurate predictions. The final predictions were generated for the test set and saved for submission, with the predicted calorie values closely matching the general scale observed in the training data
