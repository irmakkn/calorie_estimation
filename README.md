# calorie_estimation
In this project, a machine learning model was developed to predict calorie consumption based on various physiological and activity-related features, including Age, Height, Weight, Duration, Heart Rate, and Body Temperature. The dataset was preprocessed to handle outliers using logarithmic transformations for skewed features.
